          <p className="mb-8 px-4">
            After several years as a mechanical engineer, I decided to shift gears and pursue my passion for frontend development â€” a field where I can truly express my creative side through both code and design. I enjoy crafting user interfaces that are not only functional but visually engaging as well.
            <br /><br />
            I'm always eager to learn new things, adapt quickly, and thrive in agile environments. Colleagues often describe me as open-minded, a clear communicator, and someone who embraces challenges head-on.
            <br /><br />
            Whether it's experimenting with new technologies or fine-tuning UI details, I find joy in pushing myself and delivering meaningful digital experiences. If you're looking for a frontend developer who brings both creativity and precision to the table â€” let's connect!
